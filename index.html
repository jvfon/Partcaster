      <h1>Why the Strat partcaster is the most versatile guitar?</h1>
      <h2>A few reasons why</h2>
      <p>
         The Strat is probably the most recognizable guitar in the world. It is virtually 
         unchanged since the 1950's. One of the things Leo Fender and his team did right, was
         to ask musicians for their opinions about how to make an electric guitar more comfortable.
         Leo Fender basically gave to musicians what they exactly wanted. 
         The pickguard holds the key to the Strat's versatility. Just by changing the pickguard,
         you can insall virtually all the pickups being sold today.

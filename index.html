         <h3>A Bit Of History</h3>
         <p id="history">The Fender Stratocaster first came to light in
            1954 thanks to the collaboration between Leo Fender, George Fullerton
            and Freddie Tavares. Today the Strat is one of the most iconic
            if not the most iconic electric guitar ever created.

       <h3>A Modding Platform</h3>
       <p id="secondP">
          The Strat was designed to be easily mass produced. Because of this
          it is also easy for other manufacturers to recreate this iconic
          instrument. Today aftermarket companies like <a href="http://www.warmoth.com/" target="_blank">Warmoth</a>,
          <a href="http://www.usacustomguitars.com/" target="_blank">USA Custom Guitars</a>
          and <a href="https://www.allparts.com/" target="_blank">AllParts</a> to name a few are
          serve guitar player who love to tinker.
       </p>

       <p>
          One of the main reasons the Strat lends itself to mods is the
          size of the pickguard.
       </p>

       <h3>The Most Important Component</h3>
       <P id="pickups">
          Besides bodies and necks other companies have sprung up to meet the
          demand of musicians looking for a different sound. Bill Lawrence founder of
          <a href="http://wildepickups.com/" target="_blank">Wilde Pickups</a> was one of the
          pioneers of aftermarket pickups.
          <a href="https://www.seymourduncan.com/" target="_blank">Seymour Duncan Company</a> and
          <a href="https://www.dimarzio.com/" target="_blank">DiMarzio Inc.</a>
          are also two companies who have decades of experience manufacturing amazing
          guitar pickups.

       <h3>A Modding Platform</h3>
       <p id="secondP">
          The Strat was designed to be easily mass produced. Because of this
          it is also easy for other manufacturers to recreate this iconic
          instrument. Today aftermarket companies like <a href="http://www.warmoth.com/" target="_blank">Warmoth</a>,
          <a href="http://www.usacustomguitars.com/" target="_blank">USA Custom Guitars</a>
          and <a href="https://www.allparts.com/" target="_blank">AllParts</a> to name a few are
          serve guitar player who love to tinker.
       </p>

       <p>
          One of the main reasons the Strat lends itself to mods is the
          size of the pickguard.
       </p>

       <h3>The Most Important Component</h3>
       <P>
          Besides bodies and necks other companies have sprung up to meet the
          demand of musicians looking for a different sound. Bill Lawrence founder of
          <a href="http://wildepickups.com/" target="_blank">Wilde Pickups</a> was one of the
          pioneers of aftermarket pickups.
          <a href="https://www.seymourduncan.com/" target="_blank">Seymour Duncan Company</a> and
          <a href="https://www.dimarzio.com/" target="_blank">DiMarzio Inc.</a>
          are also two companies who have decades of experience manufacturing amazing
          guitar pickups.
